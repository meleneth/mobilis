make links look better ( table_print )
make link flow not redirect back to main menu
write down every time a flow feels bad
fix NR integration
~~fix having to restart several times to go through db create, db migrate, start service loop~~
add flask app
rails: add interactive service designer (models / controllers)
add a rack service wrapper that deploys as a sidecar (*handwave*)
use graphviz to show a diagram for current metaproject
~~give some documentation for expected usage / security concerns~~
rails: add multi-db-at-once support
add docker registry support (i.e. the docker container to host a docker registry)
no matter if you create a db or a rails project first, the flow should be easy and obvious to add the other, associated with whatever you made first
add ability to re-load old configuration
if generate/data exists already with data, have an option to keep or wipe the data
fix git integration so we have proper commit points between each step
add command line builder, so you can generate a tree based on an existing config
in a complex config, it feels bad when the config gets big
