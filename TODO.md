- make links look better ( table_print )
- ~~make link flow not redirect back to main menu~~
- write down every time a flow feels bad
- fix NR integration - .env file with details

- javascript (and vue): be able to specify additional packages to depend on
- ~~fix having to restart several times to go through db create, db migrate, start service loop~~
- ~~add flask app~~
- rails: add interactive service designer (models / controllers)
- add a rack service wrapper that deploys as a sidecar (*handwave*)
- use graphviz to show a diagram for current metaproject

- add ability to generate a single project (should delete instance first)
- if generate/data exists already with data, have an option to keep or wipe the data
